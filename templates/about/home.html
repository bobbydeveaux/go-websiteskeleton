The talent at DVO Media is second to none, and no one is afraid to introduce new technology and push the boundaries even further.</p>

                    <h3>Built using Go</h3>
                    <p>This site is built using Google Go (or Golang if you prefer) and is using a responsively designed theme. The page load time on a development machine is approximately 5ms, which is crazy fast compared to most websites out there, that's largely thanks to Go having great performance - some have measure it to be up to 1000x faster than PHP. Some companies are saving thousands of pounds on server architecture by simply switching from PHP to Go. To see how DVO Media can help speed up your website or web application click below.</p>
